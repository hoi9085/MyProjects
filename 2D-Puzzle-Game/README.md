## How to Run

### Compilation

Navigate to the project root directory and compile only the main source code:

```bash
javac -d bin $(find src/back src/front -name "*.java")
```

**Note:** If you don't want to compile the test files, this command excludes `src/test` automatically.

### Execution

Run the game with:

```bash
java -cp bin:src front.Main
```
