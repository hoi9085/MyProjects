# ♟️ Mastermind Project: Strategy Implementation

This project is a **school assignment** developed by a two-person team (binome). It involves the implementation of the Mastermind board game, focusing on developing and analyzing various game-solving strategies for the "codebreaker" and "codemaker" roles, as well as providing a graphical user interface (GUI).

* **Context:** SCHOOL Project (Info CPP )
* **Year:** 2023/2024
* **Default Configuration:** 4 pegs and 8 colors.

## 🚀 Implemented Strategies and Performance Analysis

The project explores a range of Codebreaker strategies, from pure randomness to information-based algorithms.

### 1. Codebreaker Strategies (CB)

### 2. Codemaker Strategies (CM)


***

## ⚙️ Project Structure and Organization

The code is logically structured into Python packages and modules for modularity and clarity.

***

## ⚠️ Execution Instructions (Compatibility Notice)
**the file structure should be "flattened" before running.**

### Deployment for Execution (Recommended Method)

1.  **Flattening:** Move **ALL Python files (`.py`)** from all subdirectories (`codebreakers/`, `codemakers/`, `tests/`, etc.) directly into the **root directory** of the project.
2.  **Execution:** Run the scripts from the root directory.

This method ensures all modules are at the same level

### Launch Examples

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tkinter`).

* **To Launch the Graphical Interface (Human vs. CM1):**
    ```bash
    python3 mastermind_gui.py
    ```
